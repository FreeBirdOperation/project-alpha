public typealias ImageLoadResult = Result<UIImage, ImageLoadError>

/**
    A class representing an image retrieved from a network source. After being loaded an ImageReference 
    instance will contain a cachedImage property that allows you to access a copy of the image that was 
    loaded from the network source.
 
    It's less safe to use this cachedImage property than it is to just load the ImageReference again 
    through an image loader, so it is preferred to load and use the image returned by that. Be aware that 
    every time you access a cached image either through a load or the cachedImage property you are 
    recieving a **copy**, so each image can be scaled or modified independently of any others if they need 
    to be used more than once.
 
    - Usage:
    ```
      let imageReference = ImageReference(withURL: NSURL("some.image.com/path/to/image.jpg"))
 
      // This is an asynchronous operation, don't expect to have the cached image 
      // available after calling this
      imageReference.load() { (image, error) in 
        // Do something with the image here
      }
 
      imageReference.cachedImage // COULD BE NIL HERE EVEN IF THE IMAGE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY LOADED
    ```
